      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who we are</h2>
      <p>This work is being carried out by DfE Digital & Technology & DfE Schools Commercial which are a part of the Department for Education (DfE). For the purpose of data protection legislation, the DfE is the data controller and processor for the personal data processed as part of the Get help buying for schools user research project.</p>
      
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we will use your information</h2>
      <p>We receive your personal data from four channels:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>The Procurement Operations team and/or specialist who referred you for this research.</li>
        <li>From yourself, by sharing information with us verbally when you participate in interviews or observed meetings with the Procurement Operations team and in written, digital consent forms hosted by Microsoft.</li>
        <li><mark>Online surveys, using the Qualtrics survey software. The data you submit via Qualtrics surveys is owned and controlled by DfE and will not be accessed unless DfE give permission to do so, for example when a support ticket is raised.</li></mark>
        <li>Publicly accessible sources such as your school or trust website.</li>
        <li><mark>IP addresses are required to be turned on for the distribution method used for this study, therefore, DfE and Qualtrics (survey software) will have access to your IP address. This information will not be shared with any other party and is for study purposes only.</li>
        <li>Information on ethnicity is optional and you are under no obligation to provide this. The DfE will only record this information for equality monitoring purposes. The DfE will not record this information without your consent and it does not influence our recruitment process. This data is valuable for ensuring we speak to a diverse range of people.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The aim for this project is to understand the experience of accessing support provided by the DfE Procurement Operations team and to identify areas for future improvement of the service.</p>
      <p>The project will explore schools' experiences of using the DfE Get Help Buying for Schools procurement service. If applicable, the project will also explore schools' experience of using external services to support procurement for their school.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The nature of your personal data we will be using</h2>
      <p>The categories of your personal data that we will be using for this project are:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number" style="padding-left: 30px">

        <li>Gender</li>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>Telephone number</li>
        <li>Geographical region</li>
        <li>Local Authority or Trust you work within</li>
        <li>Your age (if you choose to disclose)</li>
        <li>Information on disabilities (if you choose to disclose)</li>

        <li>Audio recording (if you agree to participate)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why our use of your personal data is lawful</h2>
      <p>In order for our use of your personal data to be lawful, we need to meet one (or more) conditions in the data protection legislation. For the purpose of this project, the relevant condition is:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Condition 6.1(e): processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who we will make your personal data available to</h2>

      <p>We sometimes need to make personal data available to other organisations. These might include contracted partners (who we have employed to work on the project and may therefore process your personal data on our behalf) and/or other organisations (with whom we need to share your personal data for specific purposes).</p>

      <p>Where we need to share your personal data with others, we ensure that this data sharing complies with data protection legislation. For the purpose of this project:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>Data we collect will be managed by DfE teams involved in this project. This data will also be shared with contractors from our partner agency Engine Digital and Nimble.</li>
        <li><mark>Your personal data, including but not limited to name and email address will be stored in Qualtrics (survey software) servers, to identify feedback you have submitted via surveys. This data is owned and controlled by DfE and not visible to Qualtrics teams unless a support ticket is raised.</li></mark>
        <li><mark>For security purposes, your IP address will be collected in Qualtrics (survey software) logs when you interact with the platform.  This is standard practice for any website.</li></mark>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long we will keep your personal data</h2>
 
      <p>The Department for Education will keep your personal data as part of Get help buying for schools user research project for 2 years so that we can refer back to what we’ve learned and continue to learn from our research. Following the 2 year period, your personal data will be permanently deleted.</p>
